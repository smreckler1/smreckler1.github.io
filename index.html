 <h2>What is the Appalachian Trail?</h2>

 <p>The Appalachian Trail is a 2,190+ mile long public footpath that traverses the scenic, wooded, pastoral, wild, and culturally resonant lands of the Appalachian Mountains. Conceived in 1921, built by private citizens, and completed in 1937, today the trail is managed by the National Park Service, US Forest Service, Appalachian Trail Conservancy, numerous state agencies and thousands of volunteers. People who hike it all at one time are called thru-hikers. People who hike it in pieces are called section-hikers.</p>
