  <h2>What do you need to hike?</h2>
  <p>For basic hiking, the good news is you don't need much! Some good shoes, appropriate clothes, and some water. Always, always bring water.</p>

  <h2>What do you need to backpack?</h2>
  <p>This is a much longer list and can get very expensive, very quickly. However, you can start cheaper as you are learning and invest in more expensive pieces as you go. You can also look at used gear from a variety of places. You may ultily decided sleeping in the woods with little creature comforts isn't for you, however, if it is...you'll be hooked.</p>
